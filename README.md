<!-- ## 📖 About the Project  -->
<h2 name="about-the-project">𐙚 About the project </h2>

This project was developed in **2023** as part of my *Travail de Maturité* at **ETML**.  
It is a recipe directory web application built with **Laravel** and styled entirely with **Tailwind CSS**. The project uses **phpMyAdmin** to manage a **MySQL** database.  

The platform allows users to browse a wide variety of recipes, filter them by category or ingredients, and search for specific dishes. Logged-in users can add their own personal recipes and create a shopping list based on the ingredients they are missing.
